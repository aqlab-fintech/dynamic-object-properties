# Dynamic Object Properties (DOP)
## What is this?
Dynamic Object Properties (DOP) is a utility library. It provides a framework for properties beyond Java bean properties to be defined at runtime.

Utilities are built around the concept of property descriptor. Without making copies of the original object, developers may, for example, morph an object to a Map, or create additional property at runtime.

Code in this library is on the critical path of low latency applications handling large amount of data. Memory usage and performance are obviously critical.
